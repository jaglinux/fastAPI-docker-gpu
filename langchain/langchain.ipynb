      "Physicists believe that string theory has the potential to produce a unified theory because it has the ability to incorporate and reconcile various fundamental forces in nature. In the standard model of particle physics, there are four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces.\n",

Furthermore, the standard model does not incorporate gravity, which is described by general relativity.\n",

These strings can vibrate in different ways, giving rise to different particles with various properties. By incorporating all these vibrations, string theory potentially encompasses all the fundamental particles and their interactions, including gravity.\n",
